## Project Introduction
First introduced in 1993, web browsers bookmarks are still a widely used feature for internet users to this day [1]. They are helpful to quickly access frequently used websites, as well as to save a website for future potential use. Despite their usefulness, bookmarks have suffered from design issues that hinder the user experience. For the most part, bookmarking across different web browsers have remained the same throughout the years: with a click of a button, a website is added to a list of favorites. This list can then be further divided and subdivided into different folders for additional organization. Meanwhile, since the early nineties, the way we use the internet and the amount of time spent on the latter has changed tremendously. With new features, paired with a design overhaul, the user experience can be greatly improved and provide additional value to users. Our goal for the project was to first explore the problems users face when using bookmarks. Then, with this information, we created a new bookmarking solution with improvements that directly responded to the problems previously established. The product is in the form of a Chrome extension that can be added to the Chrome browser. This browser has been chosen as it is the most used, representing 77.03% of the market share [2].
